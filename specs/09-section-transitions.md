## Goal

Implement scroll-triggered transitions between sections.

## Requirements
- Fade in/out for section content on scroll
- Parallax effect on backgrounds
- Staggered animation for text elements
- Pin section during animation (if relevant)

## E2E Test

Write test in `e2e/transitions.spec.ts`:
- Section content animates in on scroll
- Animations are smooth (no jank)

## Done when
- [ ] `npm run build` passes
- [ ] Sections fade in on scroll
- [ ] Parallax effect visible
